        <p>
          The Local Dish is an Italian based pizzeria which was established in
          the year 1995. The main restaurant locations of Local Dish are
          originally located in the home of Italy, but due to recent sales,
          we've decided to take the company overseas to further distribute our
          brand. As this is our first restaurant located overseas, we've decided
          on a way to reach new customers fairly quickly. Creating a website to
          promote Local Dish was what was decided upon within the company's
          administration board.
